# flutter_task_internship

## This Flutter application follows a customized Clean Architecture approach — implementing only the parts necessary for the project's scope, to maintain simplicity without sacrificing code organization and scalability.

✅ Key Features & Integrations
## 🔧 Clean Architecture (as needed)
Applied selected principles of Clean Architecture — such as separation between presentation, domain, and data layers — to improve code maintainability and clarity, without over-engineering the structure.

## 🔐 Authentication with Supabase
Integrated user authentication (sign up, login, logout) using Supabase Auth.

##🗄️ Supabase (Backend as a Service)
Used Supabase for real-time database operations and user profile management.

## 📦 Hive (Local Profile Caching)
Cached user profile data locally using Hive for faster access and offline support.

## 📍 Shared Preferences (Onboarding)
Stored onboarding completion status using Shared Preferences, so it's shown only once to each user.
